# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** The graph must be immediately readable -- a user looking at it should see how access flows through types, relations, and permissions without untangling spaghetti edges or guessing what connects to what.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Types & Dimension Detection

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: ERD schema cards replace compound nodes -- each type is one React Flow node
- [Roadmap]: Dimensions auto-detected from TTU tupleset patterns, not manually configured
- [Roadmap]: 1-pass flat ELK replaces 3-pass compound layout -- simpler, no route invalidation
- [Roadmap]: Same-card edges (computed, tupleset-dep) rendered as expression text, not edges

### Pending Todos
