<objective>
Final integration verification checkpoint. Human verifies all Phase 2 features work together correctly in the browser.

Purpose: Catch integration issues that individual plan testing might miss. Verify the full interaction flow: navigate subgraph via click/command palette/inspect panel, use breadcrumb/Esc/browser back to return, collapse cards, verify HUD aesthetic cohesion.

Output: Verified Phase 2 complete, or actionable issue list for gap closure.

  <files>src/App.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Human verification checkpoint. No code changes -- verify all Phase 2 features work together.

    What was built across Plans 02-01 through 02-06:
    1. HUD theming (mustard accent, floating pill toolbar, solid dark panels, dot grid canvas)
    2. Editor as left-side overlay
    3. Subgraph navigation (click permission row -> upstream, click card header -> downstream)
    4. Two-phase animated transitions (fade out, then re-layout with smooth position animation)
    5. Breadcrumb trail in bottom-left corner
    6. Esc key pops one navigation level
    7. Browser back button pops navigation via History API
    8. Card collapse via double-click (header-only, triggers re-layout)
    9. Row dimming in subgraph (~40% opacity for irrelevant rows)
    10. Self-referencing dimension info icon with tooltip
    11. Command palette with fuzzy search, grouped results, subgraph navigation on select
    12. Inspect panel with interactive tree view, re-rooting, click-to-navigate, hover-to-highlight
    13. Legend panel deleted (replaced by inspect panel)

    Start dev server: `npm run dev`
    Open browser to http://localhost:5173

    Verify each section:

    **1. HUD Aesthetic:** Toolbar at top center as floating pill, mustard active states, dot grid, dark MiniMap/Controls.
    **2. Editor Overlay:** Left-side overlay, open by default, Cmd+E toggles, slides smoothly.
    **3. Subgraph Navigation:** Click permission row -> upstream subgraph, click header -> downstream, two-phase animation, row dimming.
    **4. Breadcrumb:** Bottom-left, "Overview / node" format, clickable segments.
    **5. Navigation Controls:** Esc pops level, browser back pops, multi-level drill-in works.
    **6. Card Collapse:** Double-click collapses to header-only with row count, re-layout, no single-click conflict.
    **7. Command Palette:** Cmd+K, fuzzy search, grouped results, subgraph navigation, recently visited, keyboard nav.
    **8. Inspect Panel:** Right-side tree view, re-roots in subgraph, click-to-navigate, hover-to-highlight, filter input.
    **9. Self-Referencing Dimensions:** Info icon on matching binding rows, tooltip on hover.
    **10. Overall:** No console errors, no visual glitches on rapid clicking.
