### Unsatisfied (2)

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Reason |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|
| PATH-01 | Phase 2 | UNSATISFIED | Explicitly deferred. Store machinery exists but no UI triggers path tracing mode. Never reassigned to another phase. |
| PATH-02 | Phase 2 | UNSATISFIED | Explicitly deferred. Binding row bridge highlight indicator has no code path. Never reassigned to another phase. |

### Partial (1)

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Reason |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|
| INT-05 | Phase 2 | PARTIAL | Esc/back navigation works correctly. Breadcrumb renders and responds to clicks. But breadcrumb is hidden behind EditorPanel when panel is open (z-index conflict at left edge). |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**47/50 exports wired.** Core data pipeline fully intact end-to-end:

```
FGA DSL → parse() → detectDimensions() → assignDimensionColors() → store
  → getVisibleGraph() → toFlowElements() → getLayoutedElements() → ReactFlow render
```

### Orphaned Exports (3)

| Export | File | Issue |
|--------|------|-------|
| `expandViaTtu()` | `graph/traversal.ts` | Never imported — superseded by `computeSubgraph()` BFS |
| `computeDepthLayers()` | `graph/traversal.ts` | Never imported — obsoleted by flat ELK layout |
| `editorWidth`/`setEditorWidth` + `ResizeHandle` | `viewer-store.ts` + `components/ResizeHandle.tsx` | Dead code loop — ResizeHandle never mounted, EditorPanel uses hardcoded width |

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Paste model → parse → render graph | COMPLETE | Full pipeline wired |
| Hover row → upstream highlight | COMPLETE | BFS + opacity dimming |
| Hover card → downstream highlight | COMPLETE | BFS + opacity dimming |
| Click row → subgraph → breadcrumb → Esc back | PARTIAL | Breadcrumb hidden behind open panel |
| Cmd+K → search → navigate to result | COMPLETE | Fuse.js + navigateToSubgraph |
| Double-click → collapse card → re-layout | COMPLETE | collapsedCards Set + ELK re-layout |
| Toggle panel → Editor/Inspector tabs | COMPLETE | panelTab discriminant + tab switching |

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Items | Severity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| All | 3 orphaned exports (expandViaTtu, computeDepthLayers, ResizeHandle/editorWidth) | Low |
| Phase 2 | Missing VERIFICATION.md | Medium |
| Phase 2 | PATH-01, PATH-02 deferred but not tracked for future phase | Medium |
| Phase 3 | Missing VERIFICATION.md | Medium |
| Phase 3 | THEME-* checkboxes in REQUIREMENTS.md not updated | Low |
| Phase 3 | Plan 03-04 visual checkpoint not executed | Low |
